## ezTravel Marketing Research Project

This repository contains the final proposal, qualitative research, and quantitative research reports from a capstone project conducted at Fu Jen Catholic University (Department of Advertising & Public Relations).

## Project Overview

This project explored how young consumers (ages 18–24) perceive and engage with online travel agencies (OTAs), with a particular focus on ezTravel. The study combined qualitative and quantitative research methods to uncover insights into travel habits, platform preferences, and brand positioning in a highly competitive OTA market.

## Research Objectives

Understand the travel planning behaviors and platform usage patterns of university students.

Identify consumer perceptions and attitudes toward ezTravel compared to competitors (Booking.com, Agoda, KKday, Klook, Lion Travel, Cola Tour).

Provide strategic communication and marketing recommendations for strengthening ezTravel’s brand positioning among younger audiences.

## Methodology

Qualitative Research: Focus group interviews with university students (ages 18–24) to explore travel habits, platform perceptions, and consumer needs (see report: Qualitative Research Report).

Quantitative Research: Survey analysis (n=200+) with cluster analysis, hypothesis testing, and brand image perception mapping to evaluate OTA market segmentation (see report: Quantitative Research Report).

Final Proposal: Integrated insights into a comprehensive communication and marketing strategy for ezTravel, including SWOT, competitor analysis, and creative execution (see report: Final Proposal).

## Key Findings

Low brand loyalty: Students often switch platforms based on price and promotions.

Brand perception gap: ezTravel was seen as convenient but outdated compared to “younger” brands like Klook and KKday.

Opportunities: Students value one-stop solutions (transportation, accommodation, tickets) and would respond positively to bundled offers and platform-exclusive discounts.

Strategic implications: ezTravel must modernize its brand image and leverage targeted campaigns to capture the youth market.
